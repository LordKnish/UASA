A python based siren detector that uses volume data from audio sinks to determine if a siren has gone off.

Data is sent to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UkraineAlert) and [Telegram](https://t.co/oAoK13twYY)

Created by Aurora Knish from [Aurora Intel](https://twitter.com/AuroraIntel)

**NOTE:** _Due to the complexity of the program I do not recommend deploying it yourself. That is why I am currently developing an API so users can instead ping the API for data on alerts and deploy their own apps using that. I recommend waiting for that._
