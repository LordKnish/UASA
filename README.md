A python based siren detector that uses volume data from audio sinks to determine if a siren has gone off.

Data is sent to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UkraineAlert) and [Telegram](https://t.co/oAoK13twYY)

Created by Aurora Knish from [Aurora Intel](https://twitter.com/AuroraIntel)

**NOTE:** _Due to the complexity of the program I do not recommend deploying it yourself. That is why I am currently developing an API so users can instead ping the API for data on alerts and deploy their own apps using that. I recommend waiting for that._

To run this project, you will need to get the following libraries

```
pip install sounddevice numpy datetime pytz tweepy telepot
```

You will also need to get API keys from Telegram and Twitter:

[Twitter API keys](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwji85Swyqn2AhUOQkEAHQd0DFQQFnoECAQQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.twitter.com%2Fen%2Fdocs%2Ftwitter-api%2Fgetting-started%2Fgetting-access-to-the-twitter-api&usg=AOvVaw3rl-dk4Y3VvM4lwRfsMUbl)

[Telegram API keys](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjonqW3yqn2AhUUWsAKHeUwBZ8QFnoECAYQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcore.telegram.org%2F&usg=AOvVaw00WR4l6PW_bRSqM5hCaKEf)

Once you get the API info you will need to put it into [auth.yaml](/auth.yaml)

As well as Jack:

```

## Map creation details:

### About:
Maps are generated by me. This is to save processing power as generating a new map each time there is a detection would result in lag. 
### Color Reference for maps
